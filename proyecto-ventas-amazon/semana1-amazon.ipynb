When you need a gift in a pinch, or like me, ALMOST forget a birthday: Love the digital version gift cards that get emailed, too. HOWEVER: Be sure to check with your recipient that it was received!! Three times, I have had people either forget about the email containing the gift card, or lose the code. What’s great is that Amazon can re-issue a new digital card and can easily tell the giver if it has been redeemed. So, word of advice, it is NOT tacky to ask if received if you didn’t get the thank you are entitled to in a not so perfect world of imperfect manner.\\n\\nACTUAL CARDS: Simply said, if you are giving a gift in person, don’t settle for the simple card in plain plastic sleeve. For no extra charge, Amazon has truly wonderfully designed boxes. Free! That’s why I chose this diamond plate tin. It works for men or women, and for ANY occasion. I buy this design in advance, keep a couple “in stock” at home and ready to give. This design works for any holiday, any occasion, any taste.\\n\\nIf you actually read this, THANKS!

I grew more irritated with each page by the last half. I grew up in coastal North Carolina and was born in the 40s, so would be the same age as the main characters. It was clear that the author did not do her research about the area and about what would be plausible at the time of the story. When she mentioned real towns, she should have known Asheville would not be the destination city from the coast, especially in the 60s. Ma's old cardboard suitcase that had been in the closet in the marsh for 19 years would be covered in mildew, Fireflies would have been called lightening bugs. No boy in a small town in NC would have been named either Tate or Chase in 40s, more recent popular names. I could go on and on. The inconsistencies in the dialect was grating, and many parts of the story were just not believable to me.

First off, the drawl is insulting. We don’t talk like that. Even the uneducated hicks don’t. If her parents were well to do, they wouldn’t revert to backwoods mush mouth because of where they lived. Second, NO ONE from the coast goes to Asheville like it’s a normal thing. I live in the middle of the state. Asheville is 3-4 hours west of me. The outer banks are 5is hours from me. Driving from the coast to Asheville is an 8+ hour trip!! They’d go to Wilmington, Greenville, Rocky Mount, Raleigh. The concept of a 7 year old surviving on her own is far fetched enough, she never gets sick or hurt, can cook and clean up after herself, the shack never needs repairing, etc. But more importantly, HURRICANES!! NC gets hurricanes! Hurricane Hazel hit NC in 1954, and was completely left out of the book. Came right in off the coast, like most hurricanes do. The shack would have been destroyed. Three: the swampy parts of NC aren’t on the coast. There much more inland. You get to swamp about 100 miles before the coast and swamp doesn’t peter out to the ocean. There are pumas, cottonmouths, poisonous spiders, alligators, bears in that part of the state, but she makes it fine. Wrong geography, predictable, unbelievable story.

Let's begin with what I liked about this novel - the main character's connection to nature and the scientific facts presented throughout the story.\\n\\nNow for the novel's downfalls...\\n\\nSPOILER ALERT!\\n\\nThis story is just too improbable. From Kya raising herself beginning at a very young age, to EVERYONE leaving her, to her killing someone it was all too much for me. Kya never got sick or badly injured, needed a doctor, dentist? This strong character goes to school for one day and is bullied away? She had a wonderful relationship with her brother Jody, who then leaves her and never contacts her again for years. He left her to live in a dilapidated shack ,with an abusive, irresponsible, neglectful father. That is not something this character would have done. Next, Tate befriends her and presumably loves her. He knows everyone has left her and he does also. How could you do that to someone you love? Neither character has a reasonable excuse for not contacting her in any way for years.\\n\\nOverall, the author used too much drama to develop the character she was trying to create. Owens needs to show that she believes in the intelligence of her readers and not author-splain constantly. Yikes!

The problem for me was, amazing descriptions don\\'t wow me. Amazing stories do. And I\\'m not entirely sure this was an amazing story.\\n\\nSecond, the characters, Kya included, never really came to life for me. They all seemed flat and uninspired. At its roots, this is nothing more than a \"girl from the wrong side of the tracks\" story. Think Pretty In Pink, but set in a coastal marsh.\\n\\nThird, so much of the story line was simply implausible. From the abandonment, to the lack of interest in this young girl, to the trial--especially the trial. I can\\'t say much without giving spoiling the book, but trust me, the trial is a farce.\\n\\nFourth, the poetry throughout was incredibly annoying to me.

Easy to read, and easy to get caught up in the plight of this little girl who was left, one by one, by her entire family. It explored deep emotions and raw human nature in a subtle and delicate way. The magic of this book lies between the lines. The power of what isn’t said is where the true beauty of this book lies, if the reader allows themself to enter the author’s world. Negative reviews miss the point, I think. If you want to be spoon fed with explicit narrative describing every tiring detail of a character’s growth and development, this book isn’t for you. If you are able to enter Kya’s world, feel her struggle, pain, and heartache, and let your heart lead you beyond the black and white, then you will truly enjoy this book.'}]     4\n",

Fast almost exhausting editing, dazzling production and costume designs, great acting, and great music scenes. This movie did not disappoint at all.\\nIt focuses on the important things. Elvis's relationship to black music, his rise to fame and controversy around a white man doing black music in a segregated world, his comeback special, his early 70's career rejuvenation from his Vegas residency and touring, and the financial abuse he dealt with from The Colonel. And decides to only briefly go into the less interesting eras of Elvis.

Everyone keeps saying how much Butler looks and talks like 50's Elvis, and I disagree. I think Butler does early 70's Elvis the best, to the point where in distant shots you can't tell a difference.\\n\\nIf this movie does not get at least 7 or 8 Oscar nominations I will be shocked.

I have seen the movie a few times with friends and hubby, Even friends that are not Elvis fans absolutely loved it! The story is told through Colonel Tom Parker’s eyes.

It’s hard to get Elvis Presley’s life in two hours and 39 minutes so some of it had to be rushed and out of time stamps but still spectacular.\\n(Doing A biopic on Elvis is one mammoth of a project, he was so epic and iconic very hard to do him proud, but this movie did it) Priscilla said it best, she told Austin Butler “if Elvis was alive he would say you are me!”\\n\\nThe movie is made so young can enjoy as well as old fans, amazing soundtrack as well. If Austin Butler Doesn’t win an Oscar I will have to eat my shoe.\\n\\nI believe Tom Hanks isn’t getting a fair shake because Austin Butler was so amazing as Elvis but I think Tom Hanks did a pretty good job even though people are saying he looked Corny. It’s just that Austin Butler was just so much better. The costumes the music the edits etc. just amazing I can’t say enough about this film.

But the stuff is a ball. It was one of my favorite things to play with as a kid and every time my kids open a fresh can of it the smell brings me right back to my own childhood. And now I also picture my poor mother who l never realized at the time was probably cleaning hundreds of little play doh balls up after I got done with it and ran out to play! It's worth it, thou.

My grandson never had Play-doh before, I had no clue if he would even like it, so I figured we'd start small. (What was I thinking?!) He LOVED it.\\nFor a toddler I prefer these smaller 2 oz. cans. They're the perfect size for little hands with just the perfect amount of Play-doh. I also like the portability of the smaller cans. I can't imagine handing a toddler 10 full size cans and just letting him have at it, with these you can do exactly that.

It's LITERALLY only 1oz smaller. The standard size is 3oz, the size you're purchasing is 2oz. It may look smaller because the container itself is smaller, but the amount of playdoh itself isn't much smaller than the standard amount sold in stores.

He loves finding textured toys from around the house to use as stamps. 💙 Melissa & Doug makes a fantastic starter kit of accessories with wooden block stamps, cutters and rolling pins.

I used putty, too hard to move & rubs blisters on my fingers. Play-doh is just the right consistency and it has that great smell i remember from my childhood. Just what I need in the size I need.

If you bought this set in store it would be way overpriced, as things often are. The different colors are beautiful and so much fun to build with. The downfall of play doh is that it does go dry...but if your child is happy, and you only spent 8 dollars, I think that’s worth it. This is my second time purchasing, and I'm sure I’ll be back again.\"}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",

I figured out a few tricks to help make it easy to fill them all fast. Some reviews mentioned the balloons dry up due to long shelf life, so I drenched all the balloons before filling. I used empty laundry baskets to put the full balloons in, because the hot ground pops them. (DO NOT let filled balloons touch the ground). Once full or close to full, the weight of the water pops the balloons right off to seal themselves with a small double-looped rubber band. The rubber bands are not small and tight enough, so some of the “less than full or smaller” balloons leak slowly. Some reviews mention leaking out in their cars while driving somewhere, so the more water that is in the balloon the tighter the rubber bands will seal them. To minimize leaks, get the balloons as FULL AS POSSIBLE if you’re going to FILL-N-GO somewhere. Transport in buckets or something that can hold liquids without tipping over in your car. The balloons also do not fill up evenly, some will bust before the rest fill up. So as soon as the first 1-3 balloons fall off and seal, I give the hose a “solid quick UP and DOWN motion” and the weight from the rest will all fall off together at once and seal up immediately. The balloons collectively get pretty heavy while filling. Here in Colorado, water from the hose stays cold all year, even in the summer. The fact that the balloons are filled with freezing cold water during summer makes it a whole lot more fun. I am definitely buying more all summer. Perfect for after dinner family activity to exert energy and exhaust the kids before shower and bedtime.'}, {'review_meta': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2021', 'review_star': 'a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating', 'review_body': \"Very good value..

I tested 1 bundle prior.. And they were 40% deflated deflated 2 days later. But the rest I filled up the morning of the 4th of July and were perfect to throw by time the evening rolled around.

The Game Pass Ultimate subscription is a combination of Game Pass for Xbox, Game Pass for PC, and Xbox Gold. “Games as a service” seems to the way things are moving now, with Microsoft committing to make their first-party games available on Game Pass on launch day, but there are some drawbacks to this approach as well.\\n\\nOn the surface level, Game Pass Ultimate seems like an unbeatable value, giving you access to 100+ games on both Xbox and PC, but there are some annoyances and negatives too. Firstly, there isn’t a unified way to navigate through all of your Game Pass content. Xbox games are generally handled through the Game Pass store on your Xbox. PC games are handed in the Microsoft store app and they’re often slightly buggy or lacking in terms of control customization, graphics settings, etc. Xbox Gold gives you some free games, but you need to go through a separate process to add them to your account. Games obtained through Games with Gold work a bit differently than Game Pass in the sense that they will always be available to play (they won’t ever leave the service), with the Xbox 360 titles being yours to keep no matter what and the Xbox One titles requiring an active subscription.\\n\\n*** Update 10/15/2020 ***\\nMicrosoft has been refining the Game Pass experience since I first wrote this review. It is now easier to navigate and browse Game Pass content on both Xbox and PC. Claiming Games with Gold on Xbox no longer requires you to go through the motions of buying the game at $0.00 ~ you can just add it to your account directly. For PC, the Xbox app has been updated so that you can directly browse Game Pass content separately from the Store app. I\\'ve tried a few of the \"newer\" offerings such as MechWarrior 5 and Outer Worlds, and they have a respectable amount of customization for graphics settings, etc. Overall, Game Pass is becoming better and better.\\n\\nThe second negative is that games are constantly being added and removed, though they will give you a 30 day notice before doing so. If you’re more of a casual gamer, it might not be enough time to finish the titles and if you don’t pay attention to the Xbox news channels, you might not even know a game has been removed until it fails to start. Game Pass usually doesn’t contain the add-on content, so if you bought DLC for a Game Pass title that got removed, you won’t be able to play unless you get the main game again, either in digital or physical form.\\n\\nWith respect to this digital code purchase on Amazon, I think it’s pretty easy. The code shows up in your email box (associated with your Amazon account) after you finish checking out. If you have any promo codes such as buy-one-get-one-free, they will also show up in your mailbox. You can redeem multiple 3-month (or whatever) pre-paid memberships and they will stack up. Personally, I go to the Microsoft Accounts site and enter these codes from the subscription management area. In the case that you’ve set up a credit card for reoccurring billing, these pre-paid membership codes will basically push your billing date back.\\n\\nI\\'ve only bought codes like Xbox Live or Microsoft Office directly from Amazon, and I haven\\'t had any issues so far.'}, {'review_meta': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2019', 'review_star': 'a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating', 'review_body': 'Love this option for subscription.
